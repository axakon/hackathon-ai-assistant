# AI Code Assistants

This hackathon is mainly focused around presenting the different functionalities that are commonly bundled with AI Code Assisntants.

The most important thing is that you grasp what can be done with these tools and how they can simplify and enhance your day to day work.

## Getting started

You should have NodeJS installed locally to run the project. If you do not have NodeJS installed, use the following link to download it: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager or https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer if you want to download it via a prebuilt installer.

Once installed, run `npm install` to install the dependencies in the root of the project.

Finally, to run the .TS files, use `npx tsx {path-to-file}` in your console of choice.

## Hackathon structure

Under the `stuff-to-do` folder you will find multiple folder that highlight the different things you can do with AI Code Assistants. Under each folder, you will find some TS files and a README file that explains what we expect you to do in each case.
